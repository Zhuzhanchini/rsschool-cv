 ## Summary

My way to IT has started at late night with an email about free android developer course. I thought "Hmmm...Why not?" and sign up. It was so hard to pull myself together and completed that course because I'm 30+, I'm an economist in the Department of finance in a big university and my job is far away from coding android apps in Kotlin and my brain was shocked and tiered but in the end I was excited!

I decided to find something easier to continue my studying "from zero" and I chose HTML. My good friend was a studient of RSSchool. I asked him to show me some tasks and materials. That's how I knew more about HTML, CSS, SCSS. And so, I waited for the next set of RSSchool courses and here I am.

There are lots of stories about purposeful people who worked hard on something and changed their professions or even their lives. I want to become one of those cool boys and girls because I can and because "Hmmm...Why not?".
